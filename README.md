# mapping_earthquakes

## Purpose
For this project, I created an interactive webpage/map that visualizes earthquakes that have happened across the world in the past 7 days.

What makes this map *interactive* is the ability to select from a range of given layers, features, and styles with the click of a button. 


## Approach
I approached this by using **JavaScript** and the **D3.js** library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from a GeoJSON data. I used the **Leaflet** library to plot the data on a **Mapbox** map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
